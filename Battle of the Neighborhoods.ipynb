    "##### In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we're going to use the former statement in the question above and say that we have a client looking to open a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan, and they want to know the best location for it. We can narrow it down to a radius of 1/2 of a mile (~800m) from the heart of downtown (known as Campus Martius). Let's say this restaurant will be a seafood restaurant. Detroit has a wide variety of restaurants downtown and we'll be doing this research with the help of Foursquare and their vast location dataset on the city and its venues. By opening this new seafood restaurant this will allow citizens a wider variety to choose from when dining downtown and will generate revenue itself, surrounding venues, and for the city as a whole."

    "We'll be using the Foursquare API to request location data that we'll be using similarly to how we've used it in the New York and Toronto assignments. We'll start by specifying our initial location (Campus Martius) and setting our 800m radius, and then exploring the neighborhood for similar restaurants. We'll want to look for an area that has a decent amount of foot traffic and is decently far enough away from other seafood restaurants so the market in one area isn't over-saturated. We should take into consideration the sports arenas, casinos, and other entertainment venues as that will generate the most foot traffic. Main streets are ideal for cars driving by *and* foot traffic, but will most likely be more expensive to rent out. We'll try and find the fairest compromise for a neighborhood and see what the best option will be.\n",

    "Our relevant data needed to begin:\n",
    "- `address`: `'Detroit, MI'`, but we'll be specifying Campus Martius using it's latitude and longitude.\n",

    "Since 1452 Brush St, Detroit, MI, 48226 is listed as a restaurant space and is within 800 meters of Campus Martius, this appears to be the best location for our client's new business. It's relatively close to a heavy foot-traffic area and would be perfect for a new seafood restaurant since it's only got one competitor to keep up with in the neighborhood."

    "There are a few different approaches one could take to solving this problem. This is the most \"brute-force\" approach. We collected the data relevant to our starting location being Campus Martius and our specified radius. From there we built our map using the generated venue data that included seafood restauirants. To our surprise, there was only one we had to take into consideration in the radius. Once we built the map we then scraped building location data from a real estate website and cross referenced it using the geopy API to get building latitudes and longitudes to be mapped using Folium. From there we narrowed down our selection to include buildings suitable for restaurants and made our location selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method of doing this same task would be to use the Foursquare API to explore the areas within 800 meters of Campus Martius. We could use one-hot encoding to then find restaurants that are related to seafood. Once we had our areas that did/didn't have seafood restaurants we could then use KNN clustering to determine the areas where there is a lack of seafood choices. We could then do the same analysis we did with finding a suitable building for our client's restaurant and make our decision with the results."

    "This project as a whole was a great learning experience on how to scrape data and use it effectiely to solve a business problem that exists for business owners. I would love to revisit this problem in the future and use more advanced techniques to solve it with relative ease. I would highly recommend that any and all aspiring data scientists practice with a problem such as this to refine their own skills. "
